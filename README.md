Note: This project is akin to a dotfiles repo, however, centered around
Common Lisp - NOT intented to be useful to anyone besides myself, though one
may find it useful as a learning aid... The incentive and inspiration was
always for learning purposes.

This is my Commmon Lisp configuration resource tool project. This was started
as an idea to store my various common lisp libraries, each separately deployable
from one system. I also want it to setup my Common Lisp linux environment, i.e.
deploy rcfiles, dotfiles etc. that pertain to my workflow - a means of having a
reproducible Common Lisp environment.

The plan is that ideas/tools started here may later manifest themselves into
projects of their own. So this project is really just my Common Lisp
playground...


## Setup, Building & Testing

Currently, the setup of this project itself acts as a template on how to scaffold
a modern Common Lisp system (declarative style) along with a testing framework.
The Common Lisp code written herein also acts as a 'style guide' on my
functionality/aesthetic preferences. I also use
[ocicl](https://github.com/ocicl/ocicl) for a modern approach for Common Lisp
Systems Management, its a great tool - the only one that has a CLI to tie into a
unix/linux workflow.

The most recent addition is a testing framework (FiveAM) that has an example test
template borrowed from 
[The Common Lisp Cookbook:Testing With FiveAM](https://lispcookbook.github.io/cl-cookbook/testing.html#testing-with-fiveam).


### Setup (WIP)
A work in progreess, plan is have a setup funtionality that auto builds and
deploys my Common Lisp tools, sets up the environment, and deploys my rc/dot-files.


### Build & Test:

```lisp
* (asdf:load-system :aoforce)
* (asdf:test-system :aoforce)
```


### Play & Learn

As a fun exercise of incorporating a library, I adapted the `SDRAW` and `DTRACE` tools from
the book 
[Common Lisp: A Gentle Introduction to Symbolic Computation](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/LispBook/).
This is staged in the system/library `learn-cl`. For example, you can run the `sdraw`
learning tool (a cons cell visual aid) in this project as follows:

```lisp
;; Load Library Systems
(asdf:load-system :aoforce/libraries)

;; Enter into learn-cl/sdraw package
(in-package :learn-cl/sdraw)

(sdraw '(This (is a (test!))))
;; =>
;; [*|*]--->[*|*]--->NIL
;;  |        |
;;  v        v
;; THIS     [*|*]--->[*|*]--->[*|*]--->NIL
;;           |        |        |
;;           v        v        v
;;           IS       A       [*|*]--->NIL
;;                             |
;;                             v
;;                            TEST!

```

Another learning exercise was to create a functional calculator I wrote in Scheme,
but then translated into Common Lisp - it is also contained in the system/library
`learn-cl` under the package `:fcalc`. The CLOS based calculator can be trialed
under the package `:scalc`!

A simple calculator exhibiting the use of functional & CLOS programming 
in CL.

```lisp
;; Load Library Systems
(asdf:load-system :aoforce/libraries)

;; Enter in learn-cl/* package
(in-package :learn-cl/fcalc)
;; or (in-package :learn-cl/scalc)

(defvar *my-calc* (make-calculator 0))

(add! *my-calc* 2)
;;=> 2
;; OR
;; (add *my-calc* 2)

(multiply! *my-calc* 2)
;;=> 4
;; OR
;; (multiply *my-calc* 2)

(clear! *my-calc*)
;;=> 0
;; OR
;; (clear *my-calc*)

(get-result *my-calc*)
;;=> 0
;; OR
;; (value *my-calc*)

```

 - TBD


# Fedora Scratch Notes

## Core Development Environment (Fedora 42)
```bash
$ sudo dnf install sbcl clisp gnome-themes-extra redhat-rpm-config cmake

```

## Building Clozure CL (ccl)
Simply follow their instructions. CCL is the most beautiful bootstrap I've seen, builds
with everything it ships with (i.e. it's minimal lisp image kernel).

- Ref: CCL (Clozure CL): https://github.com/Clozure/ccl/releases/tag/v1.13

```bash
# fetch source code into directory "ccl"
$ git clone https://github.com/Clozure/ccl.git ccl

# go into the "ccl" directory where the sources are
$ cd ccl

# download pre-compiled binaries
$ curl -L -O https://github.com/Clozure/ccl/releases/download/v1.13/linuxx86.tar.gz

# unpack binaries (lisp kernel, heap image, interface database) into "ccl" directory
$ tar xf ./linuxx86.tar.gz

# Rebuild CCL to make sure everything is up-to-date with respect to the current sources.
$ echo '(rebuild-ccl :full t)' | ./lx86cl64 -n

```
